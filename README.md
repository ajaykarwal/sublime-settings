# Sublime Text 3 settings
## You should probably use Atom instead though..

This is my Sublime Text 3 configuration.

If you just want to take a look at my preference and not copy everything, have a look at my [Preferences.sublime-settings](Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings).

## Install
Quit Sublime Text 3.

### On macOS
clone into ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User

### On Windows
clone into C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User

Open Sublime Text 3. Enjoy.

You may need to [manually install Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation).
